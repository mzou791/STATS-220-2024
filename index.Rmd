## Project requirements
I've set up a repository named ***stats220*** on my existing GitHub account. It's set to public visibility, so anyone with the link can check it out. Inside, I've added a README file in Markdown format, laying out my project ideas and goals in a user-friendly way, also enhanced the appeal for viewers to visit the meme files I've created by adding some emojis..

Here are the links:

> Repository: [stats220](https://github.com/mzou791/STATS-220-2024?tab=readme-ov-file)
>
> Website: stats220 GitHub Pages

Below is a screenshot of my project folder path on my computer:
